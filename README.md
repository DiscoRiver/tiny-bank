# Tiny Bank Ledger - Design Definition

A lightweight, in-memory ledger API for tracking deposits, withdrawals, and balances.

For simplicity, the design and documentation are both represented in this README. In an ideal world I would create design docs, most likely an ERD/PRD with a supplemental ADR doc if needed.

For a micro exercise like this, I assume you're looking for fundamentals, so that's where I've focused. I am aware of double entry accounting databases such as the one [described by Square](https://developer.squareup.com/blog/books-an-immutable-double-entry-accounting-database-service/), and consensus algorithms such as Paxos and Raft, but have never implemented them.

# Overview

The Tiny Bank Ledger is a minimalistic financial transaction system that provides a RESTful API to:

* Record deposits and withdrawals
* Retrieve current balance
* View transaction history

This system is designed to be simple, fast, and stateless, running entirely in memory.

# Functional Requirements

* Deposit Money: Add funds to the ledger.
* Withdraw Money: Deduct funds from the ledger, ensuring sufficient balance.
* View Balance: Fetch the current account balance.
* Transaction History: Retrieve a list of past deposits and withdrawals.

# Non-Functional Requirements

* In-Memory Storage: No database, uses Go‚Äôs data structures (maps/slices).
* Concurrency-Safe: Uses mutex locks to prevent race conditions.
* RESTful API: Uses HTTP endpoints for interaction.
* Stateless Execution: Data is lost when the server stops.
* Minimal Dependencies: Only uses the standard Go library.

# System Design

## Architecture

```User ‚ûù HTTP API ‚ûù Ledger (In-memory)```

* The API is exposed via Go‚Äôs net/http package.
* Ledger is an internal component that handles transactions safely.

# Data Model

## Transaction
| Field   | Type   | Description                                                   |
|---------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Amount  | int    | Amount transacted (positive for deposit, negative for withdrawal) |
| Type    | string | `"deposit"` or `"withdrawal"`                                  |

## Ledger
| Field        | Type           | Description                  |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Balance     | int          | Current account balance     |
| Transactions | []Transaction | List of recorded transactions |

# API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                          | Query Params       |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| POST   | /deposit        | Deposits money into the ledger      | amount=int        |
| POST   | /withdraw       | Withdraws money (if balance allows) | amount=int        |
| GET    | /balance        | Retrieves current balance           | -                 |
| GET    | /transactions   | Fetches transaction history         | -                 |

# Concurrency & Atomicity

‚úî Mutex Locking (sync.Mutex): Ensures atomicity of transactions.  
‚úî Validation Before State Change: Prevents partial transactions.  
‚úî Thread-Safe Access to Data: No race conditions in multi-threaded execution.  

# Trade-offs & Assumptions

‚úÖ Simple & Fast: No external database overhead.  
‚úÖ No Authentication: Anyone can access the API.  
‚ùå No Persistence: Data is lost if the server restarts.  
‚ùå No Multi-Account Support: Only one account is managed.  

# How to Run
```shell
go run main.go
```

Then, interact via curl or Postman.

# Future Enhancements

üöÄ Add persistent storage (SQLite, PostgreSQL)  
üöÄ Implement authentication & authorization.  
üöÄ Add multi-account support.
